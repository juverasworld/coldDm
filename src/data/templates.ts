I noticed that {{COMPANY}} is {{OBSERVATION}}.

Most {{INDUSTRY}} companies struggle with {{PAIN_POINT}}, which leads to {{CONSEQUENCE}}. This can be frustrating, especially when {{AGITATION}}.

I help companies like yours {{SOLUTION}} without {{OBJECTION}}.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute chat to explore if this could work for {{COMPANY}}?

Best,

I noticed {{ATTENTION_HOOK}} â€“ impressive work!

We recently helped {{SIMILAR_COMPANY}} {{ACHIEVEMENT}} by {{METHOD}}.

I believe we could help {{COMPANY}} achieve {{DESIRED_OUTCOME}} through {{APPROACH}}.

Are you available for a quick call next week to discuss how this might work for you?

Looking forward to connecting,

Before: Most {{INDUSTRY}} companies struggle with {{PROBLEM}}, spending {{TIME_COST}} and losing {{MONEY_COST}}.

After: Imagine if {{COMPANY}} could {{IDEAL_OUTCOME}} with {{BENEFIT_1}} and {{BENEFIT_2}}.

Bridge: We help companies transition from {{BEFORE_STATE}} to {{AFTER_STATE}} using {{METHOD}}.

{{SOCIAL_PROOF}} did this and saw {{RESULT}}.

Would you be interested in learning how we could do the same for {{COMPANY}}?
